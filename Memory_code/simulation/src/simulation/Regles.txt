After analyzing the behavior of each client generated by the agent Generate Bank Transactions, I have developed a set of rules for each client to identify their future transactions as normal, suspect, or fraudulent. These rules are based on the client's transaction history, including the number of transactions per month or week, frequent locations, frequency of localization, average amount, interval of transaction amounts, types of habitual transactions, habitual hours, and operation status.

Here are the rules for each client:

Un système de scoring basé sur la probabilité de fraude serait également plus robuste.
